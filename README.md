# Genetic Algorithm for Clustering Iris Dataset

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm for clustering the Iris dataset. The goal is to optimize the clustering process by using a genetic algorithm, which aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of clustering.

## Project Details

- Author: Pooriya Jamie
- Project Name: Implementation of Genetic Algorithm for Clustering Iris Dataset

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. Developing and implementing a genetic algorithm tailored for clustering the Iris dataset.
2. Evaluating the algorithm's performance in optimizing the clustering process.
3. Analyzing the results and assessing the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm in enhancing clustering outcomes.

## Getting Started

To run the code and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have the required libraries installed. The necessary libraries are `pandas`, `numpy`, `random`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `sklearn.metrics`.
3. Open the `code.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Execute the code cells sequentially to run the genetic algorithm for clustering the Iris dataset.
5. Explore the implementation details and the outcomes in the notebook.

## Files and Directory Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- `code.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code implementation and analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset used in this project is available in the file `iris.data`. The dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 iris flowers, divided into three classes: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.

## Results

The results of the genetic algorithm for clustering the Iris dataset can be observed in the code notebook. The algorithm's performance is evaluated based on various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The analysis of the results helps assess the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm in enhancing clustering outcomes.

## Dependencies

The code has the following dependencies:

- pandas
